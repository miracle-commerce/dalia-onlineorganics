        "text": "<p>OnlineOrganics aims to provide the best quality organic food at wholesale prices. We work to promote local producers and have a strong environmental conscience. We source our products directly from Organic certified importers and deliver them straight to you. We eliminate the middlemen for fresher and more affordable products.<br\/><br\/><strong>Why Buy Online?<\/strong><\/p><p>Did you know that food spend months on grocery store shelves waiting to be bought? Storing the food on these shelves at bright light and 21Â°C kills the aroma and nutritional value of the food you are paying so much for. Furthermore, the food is stored in non-airtight and non moisture proof bags that compound the problem. All our food is stored in bulk in a dark refrigerated and moisture controlled warehouse. The food you receive is thus fresher than anything you can find on grocery shelves. This translates to more nutrition and better taste.<br\/><br\/><strong>What Does Organic Mean?<\/strong><\/p><p>Organic certification requires that farmers and handlers document their processes and get inspected every year. Organic on-site inspections account for every component of the operation, including, but not limited to; seed sources, soil conditions, crop health, weed and pest management, water systems, inputs, contamination and commingling risks and prevention and record-keeping. Tracing organic products from start to finish is part of the organic promise.<br\/><br\/><strong>Organic Certified Products are Produced without the Use of:<\/strong><\/p><ul><li>Synthetic fertilizers (Only natural fertilizers are allowed such as manure)<br\/><\/li><li>Artificial Ingredients (Food colors, flavors, sweeteners, etc.)<br\/><\/li><li>Toxic and persistent pesticides<br\/><\/li><li>Genetic engineering or Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)<br\/><\/li><li>Irradiation<br\/><\/li><li>Preservatives and many other processing aids and ingredients in processed foods<br\/><\/li><li>Sewage sludge (Biosolids)<br\/><br\/><\/li><\/ul><p><strong>There are 4 General Principles of Organic Production:<\/strong><\/p><ol><li><em>Principle of Health: <\/em>Organic production should sustain and enhance the health of water, soil, plants, animals, humans and the planet as one and indivisible.<br\/><\/li><li><em>Principle of Ecology: <\/em>Organic production should be based on living ecological systems and cycles, work with them, emulate them and help sustain them.<br\/><\/li><li><em>Principle of Fairness: <\/em>Organic production should build on relationships that ensure fairness with regards to the common environment and life opportunities.<br\/><\/li><li><em>Principle of Care: <\/em>Organic production should be managed in a precautionary and responsible manner to protect the health and well-being of current and future generations and the environment.<br\/><\/li><\/ol><p><\/p><p>This is what we believe in and it is the reason we do this. Eating organic is about more than the actual products, it is about those 4 principles which guide our respect of the planet and all living things.
